There he directs the <a href="http://mist.cs.wayne.edu/">Mobile and Internet Systems Laboratory</a>, <a href="http://thecarlab.org/">Connected and Autonomous Driving Laboratory</a>, <a href="http://iot.eng.wayne.edu" target="_blank">Intel IoT Innovators Lab</a>, and the Wayne State <a href="https://engineering.wayne.edu/cyber/">CPS system</a>, <a href="http://datascience.wayne.edu" target="_blank">Data Science Initiative</a> and <a href="http://wirelesshealth.wayne.edu" target="_blank">Wireless Health Initiative</a>, investigating performance, reliability, power- and energy-efficiency, trust and privacy issues of networked computer systems and applications. He founded the Metro Detroit  Workshop on Connected and Autonomous Driving (<a herf="http://cedar.wayne.edu/carlab/">MetroCAD</a>). 
						<br>Dr. Shi is one of the world leaders in the edge computing research community, and has been advocating Edge Computing (Fog Computing) since 2014,  a new computing paradigm in which the computing resources are placed at the edge of the Internet, in close proximity to mobile devices, sensors, end users and the emerging Internet of Everything. He co-chaired the NSF Workshop on Grand Challenges in Edge Computing, and was the founding steering committee chair of ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing (SEC).  He was interviewed by China Science Daily on the Rise of Edge Computing in December 2016. Part of their work on edge computing is supported by NSF and Facebook. </p>
